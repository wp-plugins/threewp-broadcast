== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I need support! =

Broadcast is sporadically supported in my spare time on the Wordpress support forum.

For users of the plugin pack, support is available via e-mail.

= Debug dumps =

A debug dump is the long text that is displayed when broadcasting a post with debug mode on. This dump can then be read to see what Broadcast is or isn't doing.

To switch on debug mode, see the admin settings. If your site is live it would be wise to input your IP in the associated textarea, so that only you see the debug dump.

= Blacklist, whitelisting, force broadcast =

Broadcasting to specific blogs, hiding blogs and forcing blogs can be acheived with the <em>User & Blog Settings</em> plugin in the <a href="https://plainviewplugins.com/threewp-broadcast-premium-pack/" title="Premium Pack's page on the web"><em>Broadcast Premium Pack</em></a>.

= Bulk broadcast existing pages =

To broadcast many posts at once, see the <em>Send To Many</em> plugin in the <a href="https://plainviewplugins.com/threewp-broadcast-premium-pack/" title="Premium Pack's page on the web"><em>Broadcast Premium Pack</em></a>.

= Galleries and attachments =

Attachments are force-broadcasted: the child posts have all their attachments deleted and then copied again.

If you have a gallery shortcode in the post ( [gallery columns="2" ids="427,433,430,429,428"] ) then Broadcast will first check that the image does not already exist on the child blog. It does this by searching for the post name (the filename minus the extension). If no image is found, it is copied.

If you have manually modified the thumbnails on the parent blog, you might want to use the <em>Duplicate Attachments</em> plugin in the plugin pack, otherwise Wordpress will generate new thumbnails on each child blog.

Do you have a lot of attachments that you don't want duplicated to hundreds of child blogs, in order to save space? You'll have to find a way to refer to the images statically instead of using their media IDs. The reason for this is that when Wordpress is referred to an attachment, it can only read the media IDs from the current blog. It cannot switch blogs in order to load the image.

= Hide broadcast from the users =

The broadcast meta box, menu and columns in the post view can be hidden from users / roles / blogs using <em>User & Blog Settings</em> plugin in the <a href="https://plainviewplugins.com/threewp-broadcast-premium-pack/" title="Premium Pack's page on the web"><em>Broadcast Premium Pack</em></a>.

= Is php v5.4 really necessary? =

Yes. PHP v5.3 has been officially unsupported since the 14th of August, 2014. If your web host refuses to upgrade to a supported version, go find a new host.

= Orphans? =

If you have already created posts on other blogs that are supposed to be children of a specific post, you can use the "find unlinked" bulk action to find and link them.

To be considered an orphan the orphaned posts must have the exact same title (name) as the soon-to-be parent and be of the same post type.

You can also use the <em>Delete Before Broadcast</em> plugin from the pack to delete any similar posts on the child blog before broadcasting.

= Timeout problems =

If you have many attachments in your post, and are broadcasting the post to many blogs, you might encounter a PHP timeout. This means that broadcasting exceeded the PHP time limit and had to be aborted.

There are several solutions to this problem:

1. Increase the PHP timeout in your PHP.ini settings. This will not speed up broadcasting, only increase your chances of completely broadcasting the post.
2. Use the <em>Duplicate Attachments</em> plugin in the pack. This will duplicate any attachments + thumbnails instead of regenerating them on each child blog.
3. Use the <em>Queue</em> plugin to put each child broadcast into a queue that is emptied by javascript.

You will not need solution #1 if you use solutions #2 and #3. :)

= Why can I not see the Broadcast meta box? =

Make sure that:

1. The plugin is network enabled
2. Your user level has broadcast access (Broadcast access role)
3. Your user has write access to more than this blog (see Admin settings > Maintenenace > View blog access). Or use the All Blogs premium plugin to access all blogs.
4. The correct post type(s) have been selected
5. <em>User & Blog Settings</em> is not set to hide the meta box from the user / role / blog

= WooCommerce =

Broadcast is capable of handling WooCommerce products.

1. In the custom post type settings: Add "product"
2. When broadcasting, select custom fields and taxonomies.

This will broadcast all normal product settings: SKU, price, etc.

If your products have variations, or you want the attribute taxonomies to be synced, you'll be wanting the WooCommerce plugin from the premium pack.

If you have a product gallery, use the "Custom Field Attachments" premium plugin to broadcast the "_product_image_gallery" custom field.

Need your stock or PDF vouchers synced upon each purchase? See the WooCommerce extras in the Plugin Pack.

= WPML Sitepress =

WPML is semi-supported via a plugin in the premium pack. For more information, see WPML discussion here: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wmpl-integration-not-working

The author suggests using PolyLang instead due to far superior support.

= XCache vs APC opcode cache =

APC works flawlessly.

Xcache v2 does not support PHP namespaces, which is a PHP 5.3 feature. Trying to enable Broadcast with Xcache v2 enabled will result in a PHP crash.

Xcache v3, which does support namespaces, has not yet been tested. Anyone with Xcache v3 experience is welcome to contact me with info.

= 22 20150721 =
* New: post delete, trash and restore hooks are now always monitored, instead of just during the display of the posts table. This should allow other plugins to modify posts (perhaps expiring posts?) without unsynchronizing the link info.
* UI: Admin settings are now the Broadcast menu item itself.
* UI: Settings are now displayed in different tabs. Custom post settings are now part of normal settings.
* UI: Broadcast menu item is not shown at all to users who may not use broadcast.

= 21 20150705 =
* New: Broadcast now hooks into the network admin menu.
* Fix: Attachments that are also the featured image will no longer be deleted. This fixes broken links to the two images, which are actually the same.

* Fix: Display the blog domain in the meta box if the blog name is empty.

* Code: New attachment_data/copied_attachments helper.
* Code: broadcasting_data->broadcast_to() can now take a simple blog ID integer.
* Code: broadcasting_data handles more setup itself, instead of relying on others.
* Code: broadcasting_data now defaults to true for custom fields, linking and taxonomies.

= 20 20150609 =
* New: Custom field handling has been simplified. The "broadcast internal field" setting has been removed and the blacklist, whitelist and protect list now apply to all fields.

The custom field settings can now handle wildcards.

If you do not wish the internal custom fields (the ones that start with an underscore) to be broadcasted, check that you now have _* in the blacklist.

Custom fields are now handled in this order: first check the blacklist, if blacklisted checked the whitelist.

The protect list is applied to the surviving custom fields specified to be protected.

* Fix: Reload broadcast data upon switching blogs during broadcasting. This is probably the cause of half-linked children when broadcasting is interrupted or queued.
* Fix: Posts can have several thousand child posts now. The database column was set too small (text instead of longtext) to allow for all too many child links.
* Code: More debug info. Custom field lists are dumped.
* Code: Fix saving of broadcast data so that it can be resaved during the same broadcast.
* Code: Debug dump now shows HTML tags.
* Updated .pot file for translations.
